# 🚌 Assessment of Customer Satisfaction of Bus Services in Tirana

This project explores and models factors that influence **customer satisfaction** with **urban bus services in Tirana, Albania**.  
It uses survey data collected from passengers to understand perceptions about cleanliness, safety, bus conditions, waiting times, and more.

---

##  Objectives
- Analyze survey responses about public transport satisfaction  
- Identify key variables affecting satisfaction  
- Build and evaluate a **linear regression model** to predict overall satisfaction  
- Visualize correlations and trends between service factors and satisfaction  

---

##  Key Variables

| Category | Example Variables |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Demographics** | Gender, Age Group |
| **Bus Stops** | Cleanliness, Information, Safety |
| **Bus Interior** | Temperature, Crowdedness, Cleanliness |
| **Service** | Waiting Time, Travel Time, Driver Helpfulness |
| **Satisfaction** | General satisfaction rating (0–10) |

##  Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas** – data handling  
- **NumPy** – numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – regression modeling and evaluation
